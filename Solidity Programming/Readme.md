## âœ… Contracts and Concepts

### 1. `HelloWorld.sol`
- Introduces state variables and how to make them publicly accessible.
- Demonstrates how to store a simple string.

### 2. `SimpleStorage.sol`
- Teaches how to store and retrieve unsigned integer values using functions.

### 3. `Counter.sol`
- Shows how to increment and decrement a counter with basic validation.

### 4. `Ownership.sol`
- Covers constructors, access control, and managing ownership with `msg.sender`.

### 5. `Payment.sol`
- Demonstrates how to accept Ether payments and log them using events.

### 6. `MappingExample.sol`
- Introduces mappings to associate data with addresses.

### 7. `StructExample.sol`
- Explains how to define and use structured data types (`struct`).

### 8. `EnumExample.sol`
- Teaches the use of enums to manage states or categories.

### 9. `ArrayExample.sol`
- Shows how to work with dynamic arrays and retrieve their contents.

### 10. `ModifierExample.sol`
- Introduces function modifiers to reuse code and control access.

### 11. `EventsExample.sol`
- Covers event logging and how to emit events with parameters.

### 12. `InheritanceExample.sol`
- Explains inheritance between contracts and how to extend functionality.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. **Install Tools**
   - Use [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org) for a quick web-based environment.
   - Alternatively, set up **Hardhat**, **Truffle**, or other frameworks for local development.

2. **Compile Contracts**
   - Use Solidity version `^0.8.20`.

3. **Deploy and Test**
   - Deploy each contract individually.
   - Interact with functions to understand how data is stored and retrieved.

4. **Explore and Extend**
   - Modify contracts to test edge cases.
   - Combine multiple concepts, such as using mappings with structs or inheritance with events.

## ‚úÖ Quiz Answer Key

| # | Answer Summary |
|---|----------------|
| 1 | The "matching problem" refers to barter inefficiencies. Money solved it by providing a universally accepted medium of exchange, unit of account, and store of value. |
| 2 | Double spending is when a digital coin is spent more than once. Bitcoin uses decentralized consensus and Proof of Work to prevent this. |
| 3 | Miners validate transactions and add blocks by solving puzzles. The first to solve gets a reward. |
| 4 | DLT distributes the ledger among participants, enhancing transparency and security compared to centralized systems. |
| 5 | The 2008 crisis exposed flaws in centralized finance and motivated Bitcoin's creation as a decentralized alternative. |
| 6 | PoW requires computational effort to solve puzzles, ensuring tamper-proof transactions and preventing fraud. |
| 7 | A Merkle Tree summarizes transactions with cryptographic hashes, enabling fast and secure verification without downloading the entire block. |
| 8 | Symmetric cryptography uses one key for encryption and decryption; asymmetric uses a public-private key pair. |
| 9 | DeFi enables trustless finance with no intermediaries, relying on mining, lending protocols, and smart contracts. |
|10 | Interoperability allows blockchains to exchange data, fostering broader adoption and seamless cross-network interactions. |

## ‚úçÔ∏è Essay Format Questions

1. Compare and contrast the characteristics, advantages, and disadvantages of Public, Private, and Consortium blockchain networks. Provide examples of use cases for each type.
2. Discuss the evolution of money from barter to digital currencies, highlighting the key problems addressed at each stage. How does blockchain fit into this historical progression, and what "properties of money" does it enhance?
3. Explain the core principles of cryptography as applied to blockchain technology. Detail how symmetric and asymmetric encryption contribute to security, and analyze the significance of hash functions in maintaining data integrity and network security.
4. Analyze the concept of "double spending" and how various cryptographic and consensus mechanisms within Bitcoin specifically address this challenge.
5. Examine "Decentralized Finance (DeFi)" and its potential impact on traditional finance. Discuss motivations, components, and risks associated with its adoption.
